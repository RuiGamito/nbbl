## Used technology (so far)
* Selenium (Python bindings)
* Locust
* ab (Apache Benchmark)

## Dev log
Below you can find a diary (of sorts) of my progress.

### Day 0
 * Familiarize myself with the exercises
 * Interact a bit with Annotation
   * Oh boy, I'm so not into this translation business
 
### Day 1
 * Select Selenium (Python bindings) for the automation exercise
   * Fiddle a bit with the DOM
 * Browse around for load testing software
   * Locust seems VERY interesting
   
### Day 2
 * Finally create the repo ;)
 * First commit for the automation exercise (incomplete for now...)
 * Locust working nice with load testing the endpoint
   * Results show some underperfomance, but I might just need to get more acquainted with the tool
   * Maybe crosscheck results with 'ab'
